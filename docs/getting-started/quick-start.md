## Overview

At the moment these instructions have been tested against Kubernetes 1.25 and above,
other kubernetes or OpenShift environments may require minor adjustment.

One important note about operators in general is that to get the operator
installed requires cluster-admin level privileges. Once installed, a regular
user should be able to install ActiveMQ Artemis via the provided custom
resource.

## General environment requirements

Currently the operator is tested against kubernetes v1.25 and above.
You can install a [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or a [CodeReady Containers(CRC)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview) to deploy the operator.

## Getting the code and build the image

To launch the operator you will need to clone the [activemq-artemis-operator](https://github.com/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-operator) and checkout the main branch.

(Optional) Follow the [building]({{< ref "../help/building.md" >}}) instructions, tag, and push it into your project
namespace.

## Deploying the operator

Create the namespace activemq-artemis-operator and save it for all subsequent kubectl commands
```shell
$ kubectl create namespace activemq-artemis-operator
$ kubectl config set-context --current --namespace activemq-artemis-operator
```

To deploy the operator in the current namespace activemq-artemis-operator simply run:

```shell
$ ./deploy/install_opr.sh
```
or if you have built your own image, change the image defined in deploy/operator.yaml before deploy the operator.

The operator will be deployed into the current namespace and watches the same namespace.

To watch specific namespaces or all namespaces, run the command below and it will ask which namespaces you want to watch.

```shell
$ ./deploy/cluster_wide_install_opr.sh
```

At this point you should see the activemq-artemis-operator starting up and if you check the
pods you should see something like

```$shell
$ kubectl get pod -n activemq-artemis-operator
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activemq-artemis-controller-manager-5ff459cd95-kn22m   1/1     Running   0          70m
```

## Deploying the broker

Now that the operator is running and listening for changes related to our crd we can deploy our [artemis single example](../../examples/artemis/artemis_single.yaml)
which looks like

```$yaml
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: artemis-broker
```  

Note in particular the **spec.image** which identifies the container image to use to launch the AMQ Broker. If it's empty, 'placeholder' or not defined it will get the latest default image url from deploy/operator.yaml where a list of supported broker image are defined as environment variables.

To deploy the broker simply execute

```$shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/artemis/artemis_single.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemis.broker.amq.io/artemis-broker created
```
In a moment you should see one broker pod is created alongside the operator pod:

```$shell
$ kubectl get pod -n activemq-artemis-operator
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activemq-artemis-controller-manager-5ff459cd95-kn22m   1/1     Running   0          128m
artemis-broker-ss-0                                    1/1     Running   0          23m
```

## Scaling

The spec.deploymentPlan.size controls how many broker pods you want to deploy to the cluster. You can change this value and apply it to a running deployment to scale up and scale down the broker pods.

For example if you want to scale up the above deployment to 2 pods, modify the size to 2:

examples/artemis/artemis_single.yaml
```$yaml
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: artemis-broker
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    size: 2
```
and apply it:

```$shell
$ kubectl apply -f examples/artemis/artemis_single.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemis.broker.amq.io/artemis-broker configured
```

and you will get 2 broker pods in the cluster

```$shell
$ kubectl get pod -n activemq-artemis-operator
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activemq-artemis-controller-manager-5ff459cd95-kn22m   1/1     Running   0          140m
artemis-broker-ss-0                                    1/1     Running   0          35m
artemis-broker-ss-1                                    1/1     Running   0          69s
```

You can scale down the deployment in similar manner by reducing the size and apply it again.

### Clustering

By default if broker pods are scaled to more than one then the broker pods form a broker
[cluster](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/clusters.html), meaning connect to each other and redistribute messages using default 'ON_DEMAND' policy. 

## Undeploying the broker

To undeploy the broker we simply execute

```$shell
$ kubectl delete -f examples/artemis/artemis_single.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemis.broker.amq.io "artemis-broker" deleted
```

## Managing Queues

### Overview

Users can use the activemqartemisaddress CRD to create and remove queues/address on a running broker pod.

Having [a deployed broker pod](#deploying-the-broker) is necessary to apply the commands in this section.

Assuming you have one already running, you can then deploy an activemqartemisaddress resource from the [examples dir](../../examples/address/address_queue.yaml):

address-queue.yaml:
```$yaml
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
  name: artemis-address-queue
spec:
  addressName: myAddress0
  queueName: myQueue0
  routingType: anycast
  removeFromBrokerOnDelete: true
```

and the deploy command:

```$shell
$ kubectl create -f examples/address/address_queue.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemisaddress.broker.amq.io/artemis-address-queue created
```

When it is deployed it will create a queue named **myQueue0** on an address **myAddress0** with **anycast** routing type, like:

```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-0 --container artemis-broker-container -- amq-broker/bin/artemis queue stat
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0.artemis-broker-hdls-svc.activemq-artemis-operator.svc.cluster.local:61616
|NAME                     |ADDRESS                  |CONSUMER_COUNT|MESSAGE_COUNT|MESSAGES_ADDED|DELIVERING_COUNT|MESSAGES_ACKED|SCHEDULED_COUNT|ROUTING_TYPE|
|DLQ                      |DLQ                      |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|ExpiryQueue              |ExpiryQueue              |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|activemq.management.27...|activemq.management.27...|1             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |MULTICAST   |
|myQueue0                 |myAddress0               |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
```

The **spec.removeFromBrokerOnDelete** controls how to deal with the created queue/address resources when you delete the above custom resource:

```$shell
$ kubectl delete -f examples/address/address_queue.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemisaddress.broker.amq.io "artemis-address-queue" deleted
```

If **spec.removeFromBrokerOnDelete** is true, the queue/address resources will be deleted from broker.
If it is false, the queue/address created by this custome resource will be kept in broker even after the custom resource has been deleted.

You can check if the queue was removed using the command below:
```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-0 --container artemis-broker-container -- amq-broker/bin/artemis queue stat
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0.artemis-broker-hdls-svc.activemq-artemis-operator.svc.cluster.local:61616
|NAME                     |ADDRESS                  |CONSUMER_COUNT|MESSAGE_COUNT|MESSAGES_ADDED|DELIVERING_COUNT|MESSAGES_ACKED|SCHEDULED_COUNT|ROUTING_TYPE|
|DLQ                      |DLQ                      |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|ExpiryQueue              |ExpiryQueue              |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|activemq.management.d9...|activemq.management.d9...|1             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |MULTICAST   |
```

## Draining messages on scale down

When a broker pod is being scaled down, a scaledown controller can be deployed aumatically to handle message migration from the scaled down broker pod to an active broker.

When the scale down controller detects the event it starts a drainer pod.
The drainer pod will contact one of the live pods in the cluster and drain the messages over to it.
After the draining is complete it shuts down itself.

The message draining only works when you enabled persistence and messageMigration on broker custome resource.
For example, you can deploy a cluster from our [broker cluster persistence example](../../examples/artemis/artemis_cluster_persistence.yaml)

```$yaml
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: artemis-broker
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    size: 2
    persistenceEnabled: true
    messageMigration: true
```

To demonstrate the message draining first deploy the above custom resource (assuming the operator is running):

```$shell
$ kubectl create -f ./examples/artemis/artemis_cluster_persistence.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemis.broker.amq.io/artemis-broker created
```

You shall see 2 broker pods are created.

```$shell
$ kubectl get pod -n activemq-artemis-operator
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activemq-artemis-controller-manager-5ff459cd95-kn22m   1/1     Running   0          3h19m
artemis-broker-ss-0                                    1/1     Running   0          89s
artemis-broker-ss-1                                    1/1     Running   0          53s
```

Now we'll use broker's cli tool to send some messages to each broker pod. 

First send 100 messages to broker **artemis-broker-ss-0**:

```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-0 -- amq-broker/bin/artemis producer --url tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0:61616 --message-count=100
Defaulted container "artemis-broker-container" out of: artemis-broker-container, artemis-broker-container-init (init)
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0:61616
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Started to calculate elapsed time ...

Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Produced: 100 messages
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Elapsed time in second : 0 s
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Elapsed time in milli second : 409 milli seconds
```

then send another 100 messages to broker **artemis-broker-ss-1**

```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-1 -- amq-broker/bin/artemis producer --user x --password y --url tcp://artemis-broker-ss-1:61616 --message-count=100
Defaulted container "artemis-broker-container" out of: artemis-broker-container, artemis-broker-container-init (init)
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-1:61616
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Started to calculate elapsed time ...

Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Produced: 100 messages
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Elapsed time in second : 0 s
Producer ActiveMQQueue[TEST], thread=0 Elapsed time in milli second : 466 milli seconds
```

Now each of the 2 brokers has 100 messages. 

```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-0 --container artemis-broker-container -- amq-broker/bin/artemis queue stat
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0.artemis-broker-hdls-svc.activemq-artemis-operator.svc.cluster.local:61616
|NAME                     |ADDRESS                  |CONSUMER_COUNT|MESSAGE_COUNT|MESSAGES_ADDED|DELIVERING_COUNT|MESSAGES_ACKED|SCHEDULED_COUNT|ROUTING_TYPE|
|DLQ                      |DLQ                      |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|ExpiryQueue              |ExpiryQueue              |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|TEST                     |TEST                     |0             |100          |100           |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|activemq.management.14...|activemq.management.14...|1             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |MULTICAST   |
```

```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-1 --container artemis-broker-container -- amq-broker/bin/artemis queue stat
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-1.artemis-broker-hdls-svc.activemq-artemis-operator.svc.cluster.local:61616
|NAME                     |ADDRESS                  |CONSUMER_COUNT|MESSAGE_COUNT|MESSAGES_ADDED|DELIVERING_COUNT|MESSAGES_ACKED|SCHEDULED_COUNT|ROUTING_TYPE|
|DLQ                      |DLQ                      |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|ExpiryQueue              |ExpiryQueue              |0             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|TEST                     |TEST                     |0             |100          |100           |0               |0             |0              |ANYCAST     |
|activemq.management.2a...|activemq.management.2a...|1             |0            |0             |0               |0             |0              |MULTICAST   |
```

Modify the ./examples/artemis/artemis_cluster_persistence.yaml to scale down to one broker

```$yaml
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  name: artemis-broker
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    size: 1
    persistenceEnabled: true
    messageMigration: true
```
and re-apply it:
```$shell
$ kubectl apply -f ./examples/artemis/artemis_cluster_persistence.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemis.broker.amq.io/artemis-broker configured
```

The broker pods will be reduced to only one

```$shell
$ kubectl get pod -n activemq-artemis-operator
NAME                                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
activemq-artemis-controller-manager-5ff459cd95-kn22m   1/1     Running   0          3h57m
artemis-broker-ss-0                                    1/1     Running   0          39m
```

Now the messages on the broker pod **artemis-broker-ss-1** should have been all migrated to pod **artemis-broker-ss-0**.
Use the broker cli tool again to check:

```$shell
$ kubectl exec artemis-broker-ss-0 -- amq-broker/bin/artemis queue stat --url tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0:61616
Defaulted container "artemis-broker-container" out of: artemis-broker-container, artemis-broker-container-init (init)
Connection brokerURL = tcp://artemis-broker-ss-0:61616

```
You can see the queue TEST has 200 messages now.

## Using a operator extraMounts

ActiveMQArtemis custom resource allows you to define extraMounts which will mount secrets and/or configmaps with 
configuration information as files to be used in the artemis configuration. One usage of extraMounts is to 
redefine the log4j file used by artemis to log information. [Here](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/latest/logging.html#logging) you can find details about artemis logging configuration.

To use a custom logging you will need a log4j configuration file. The default log4j configuration file can be used as
an initial example and can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker-kubernetes-image/main/modules/activemq-artemis-launch/added/log4j2.properties)

Assuming you already have the operator deployed, in our example we are going to modify the default logging file and enable the audit logging. You will need to modify the log4j2.properties file and change the lines as below:

```shell
$ sed -i 's/logger.audit_base.level = OFF/logger.audit_base.level = INFO/' log4j2.properties
$ sed -i 's/logger.audit_resource.level = OFF/logger.audit_resource.level = INFO/' log4j2.properties
$ sed -i 's/logger.audit_message.level = OFF/logger.audit_message.level = INFO/' log4j2.properties
```

Then you will need to create configMap or a secret in your namespace. The configMap or secret name must have a suffix of `-logging-config` and the key must be `logging.properties`

```$shell
$ kubectl create secret generic newlog4j-logging-config --from-file=logging.properties=log4j2.properties -n activemq-artemis-operator
secret/newlog4j-logging-config created
```

After the secret creation it should be like this:
```$shell
$ kubectl describe secret newlog4j-logging-config -n activemq-artemis-operator
Name:         newlog4j-logging-config
Namespace:    activemq-artemis-operator
Labels:       <none>
Annotations:  <none>

Type:  Opaque

Data
====
logging.properties:  2687 bytes
```

The next step is to define the extraMount in the ActiveMQArtemis custom resource like in our [example](../../examples/artemis/artemis_custom_logging_secret.yaml) and deploy it.

```$shell
$ kubectl create -f ./examples/artemis/artemis_custom_logging_secret.yaml -n activemq-artemis-operator
activemqartemis.broker.amq.io/artemis-broker-logging created
```

Then you should be able to see some audit log entries after the artemis start:

```$shell
$ kubectl logs artemis-broker-logging-ss-0 -n activemq-artemis-operator |grep audit
Defaulted container "artemis-broker-logging-container" out of: artemis-broker-logging-container, artemis-broker-logging-container-init (init)

```

You can also do the same using configMaps instead of secrets. Just create a configMap like:

```$shell
$ kubectl create configmap newlog4j-logging-config --from-file=logging.properties=log4j2.properties -n activemq-artemis-operator
secret/newlog4j-logging-config created
```

and use the [example](../../examples/artemis/artemis_custom_logging_configmap.yaml)
